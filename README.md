# expression
This is a C++ library that provides simple operations on math expressions.My motivation is to use it to solve complex polynomial calculations in analytic geometry math problems (although the realization of fractions has not yet begun).This library does not pursue too high performance, but pursues a concise and close to mathematical language expression.This is a project of interest. I am a student and don't have much time. I don’t know much about project design, and I’m happy to be taught if someone wants.
